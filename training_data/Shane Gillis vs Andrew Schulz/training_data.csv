36,00:01:20.280,80280,00:01:22.300,82300,chunk37.wav,29300,I said this video here is going to look
37,00:01:22.040,82040,00:01:23.919,83919,chunk38.wav,25146,at all three of his flagrant appearances
38,00:01:24.320,84320,00:01:26.219,86219,chunk39.wav,28705,and I'm going to show you how Shane
39,00:01:25.799,85799,00:01:28.459,88459,chunk40.wav,24791,turned the tables on Andrew Schultz in
40,00:01:28.119,88119,00:01:31.259,91259,chunk41.wav,27753,the short space of only two years what
41,00:01:31.119,91119,00:01:34.359,94359,chunk42.wav,30246,started with this newly viral sensation
42,00:01:34.399,94399,00:01:37.639,97639,chunk43.wav,29512,Shane Gillis is in the building ended up
43,00:01:37.600,97600,00:01:40.539,100539,chunk44.wav,30210,like this I love SCH talk Schultz
44,00:01:40.880,100880,00:01:43.679,103679,chunk45.wav,16473,epiphanies are my favorite y he repeats
45,00:01:43.479,103479,00:01:46.299,106299,chunk46.wav,16480,his St that's crazy
46,00:01:46.479,106479,00:01:49.259,109259,chunk47.wav,30249,though and so the context here is really
47,00:01:49.119,109119,00:01:51.519,111519,chunk48.wav,30405,important back in 2019 Gillis was fired
48,00:01:52.040,112040,00:01:54.099,114099,chunk49.wav,30396,from Saturday Night Live before he'd had
49,00:01:53.920,113920,00:01:56.120,116120,chunk50.wav,28234,a chance to start working after a couple
50,00:01:56.159,116159,00:01:58.219,118219,chunk51.wav,29932,of videos resurfaced of him making
51,00:01:58.320,118320,00:02:00.460,120460,chunk52.wav,29577,supposedly offensive remarks about
52,00:02:00.280,120280,00:02:02.719,122719,chunk53.wav,30221,Chinese people on his podcast but it
53,00:02:02.600,122600,00:02:05.260,125260,chunk54.wav,29281,wasn't until almost 2 years later that
54,00:02:05.159,125159,00:02:07.299,127299,chunk55.wav,25316,he appeared for the first time on JRE
55,00:02:07.920,127920,00:02:09.740,129740,chunk56.wav,30304,that he really started to make his way
56,00:02:09.440,129440,00:02:11.680,131680,chunk57.wav,28576,back into the mainstream meanwhile
57,00:02:11.560,131560,00:02:14.140,134140,chunk58.wav,29682,Andrew schz had become insanely popular

62,00:02:23.599,143599,00:02:25.499,145499,chunk63.wav,30434,time he'd released three comedy specials
63,00:02:25.440,145440,00:02:27.240,147240,chunk64.wav,28810,and was working on his fourth whereas

85,00:03:20.319,200319,00:03:23.219,203219,chunk86.wav,15024,reason newly viral sensation Shane
86,00:03:22.920,202920,00:03:26.340,206340,chunk87.wav,19303,Gillis is in the building doing his 20th
87,00:03:26.120,206120,00:03:28.600,208600,chunk88.wav,18575,podcast in the last week you probably
88,00:03:29.760,209760,00:03:31.539,211539,chunk89.wav,28909,heard there Schult saying this was

90,00:03:33.319,213319,00:03:35.339,215339,chunk91.wav,30977,past week and that's because he just
91,00:03:35.280,215280,00:03:37.439,217439,chunk92.wav,30254,released his first special like I said
92,00:03:37.360,217360,00:03:39.720,219720,chunk93.wav,30403,before and he was doing the podcast
93,00:03:39.599,219599,00:03:42.399,222399,chunk94.wav,30104,rounds after Rogan anointed him a chosen
94,00:03:42.080,222080,00:03:44.680,224680,chunk95.wav,30696,one earlier that year in July and so
95,00:03:45.200,225200,00:03:47.340,227340,chunk96.wav,27589,came the accusations from Schulz and his
96,00:03:47.280,227280,00:03:49.480,229480,chunk97.wav,28545,boy band that Gillis was low energy in

289,00:10:55.480,655480,00:10:58.300,658300,chunk290.wav,30562,for 30 or 40 minutes and it feels like
290,00:10:57.880,657880,00:11:00.840,660840,chunk291.wav,30329,only 5 minutes have past but man Schulz
291,00:11:01.120,661120,00:11:03.539,663539,chunk292.wav,29794,was uncomfortable for this whole podcast
292,00:11:03.800,663800,00:11:05.960,665960,chunk293.wav,27727,it was almost like he was intimidated by
293,00:11:05.959,665959,00:11:08.219,668219,chunk294.wav,29925,Shane and he was desperate to come off
294,00:11:08.120,668120,00:11:10.520,670520,chunk295.wav,28064,as the funnier guy which is lame seeing
295,00:11:10.480,670480,00:11:12.860,672860,chunk296.wav,30207,as they were both accomplished Comics at
296,00:11:12.920,672920,00:11:15.260,675260,chunk297.wav,30973,the time Schultz was only 38 Gillis was
297,00:11:15.240,675240,00:11:17.400,677400,chunk298.wav,23972,34 and in comedian years that's
298,00:11:17.600,677600,00:11:19.520,679520,chunk299.wav,30028,basically just getting started right
299,00:11:19.560,679560,00:11:22.000,682000,chunk300.wav,27970,it's pretty rare to see a super famous
300,00:11:21.440,681440,00:11:24.359,684359,chunk301.wav,27838,comedian under the age of 35 even though
301,00:11:24.440,684440,00:11:26.800,686800,chunk302.wav,26216,there are a few exceptions and so Schulz
302,00:11:27.279,687279,00:11:29.039,689039,chunk303.wav,29006,tries to put one over Gillis by bringing
303,00:11:29.160,689160,00:11:30.800,690800,chunk304.wav,29484,up this random phone call they had
304,00:11:30.800,690800,00:11:33.260,693260,chunk305.wav,30546,before the show where Shane called him
305,00:11:32.440,692440,00:11:34.880,694880,chunk306.wav,30934,to confirm that the podcast was still on
306,00:11:35.720,695720,00:11:37.480,697480,chunk307.wav,28863,and I think the reason may have been
307,00:11:37.320,697320,00:11:39.240,699240,chunk308.wav,22341,that Shane's appearances on flagrant are
308,00:11:39.240,699240,00:11:40.840,700840,chunk309.wav,30562,always in October I actually only
309,00:11:41.160,701160,00:11:42.700,702700,chunk310.wav,27992,noticed that when I was putting this
310,00:11:42.440,702440,00:11:44.479,704479,chunk311.wav,29075,video together and so I'm thinking that
311,00:11:44.240,704240,00:11:46.240,706240,chunk312.wav,29841,Shane has an October appearance penciled
312,00:11:46.519,706519,00:11:48.219,708219,chunk313.wav,25763,in on flagrant as some sort of
313,00:11:48.240,708240,00:11:50.060,710060,chunk314.wav,25558,Gentleman's Agreement or something like
314,00:11:49.920,709920,00:11:51.719,711719,chunk315.wav,29057,that so with that in mind it kind of
315,00:11:51.880,711880,00:11:53.900,713900,chunk316.wav,29840,makes sense why he would call that
316,00:11:53.519,713519,00:11:56.279,716279,chunk317.wav,30674,morning to confirm it was on and just to

588,00:21:54.640,1314640,00:21:56.980,1316980,chunk589.wav,29765,most recent appearance versus his first
589,00:21:56.679,1316679,00:21:59.479,1319479,chunk590.wav,30358,one it's crazy how much Gillis has grown
590,00:21:59.320,1319320,00:22:02.179,1322179,chunk591.wav,30237,into his Fame in just two years time and
591,00:22:02.279,1322279,00:22:04.479,1324479,chunk592.wav,30393,the contrast with Schultz is wild I'm
592,00:22:05.039,1325039,00:22:06.939,1326939,chunk593.wav,27546,noticing more and more that Schultz is
593,00:22:06.679,1326679,00:22:08.739,1328739,chunk594.wav,29837,becoming really bitter as the years go
594,00:22:08.840,1328840,00:22:11.160,1331160,chunk595.wav,30702,by and I think it has a lot to do with
595,00:22:10.799,1330799,00:22:13.219,1333219,chunk596.wav,30266,where he sits in the Rogan Comedy Circle
596,00:22:13.480,1333480,00:22:15.579,1335579,chunk597.wav,30591,he still living in New York whereas guys
597,00:22:15.640,1335640,00:22:17.779,1337779,chunk598.wav,25569,like Tim Dylan Tom seura Tony
598,00:22:17.679,1337679,00:22:19.879,1339879,chunk599.wav,27846,Hinchcliffe and of course Shane Gillis
599,00:22:19.919,1339919,00:22:22.079,1342079,chunk600.wav,30648,have all moved to Austin after Rogan
600,00:22:22.080,1342080,00:22:24.059,1344059,chunk601.wav,26824,made the move there during the pandemic
601,00:22:24.240,1344240,00:22:26.560,1346560,chunk602.wav,28990,so even though Schultz is still close to
602,00:22:26.039,1346039,00:22:28.479,1348479,chunk603.wav,30637,Rogan and has regular appearances on JRE
603,00:22:28.880,1348880,00:22:31.540,1351540,chunk604.wav,29995,Gillis goes on there several times a
604,00:22:30.919,1350919,00:22:33.799,1353799,chunk605.wav,29807,year in 2023 alone Shane had seven
605,00:22:34.200,1354200,00:22:36.520,1356520,chunk606.wav,30186,appearances on JRE whereas Schulz had
606,00:22:36.679,1356679,00:22:38.759,1358759,chunk607.wav,28380,only one and it seems like he's
607,00:22:38.840,1358840,00:22:40.780,1360780,chunk608.wav,29236,basically just doing one per year at the
608,00:22:40.840,1360840,00:22:42.720,1362720,chunk609.wav,25159,moment and I mean that's not the be all
609,00:22:42.720,1362720,00:22:44.520,1364520,chunk610.wav,30097,end or measurement of comedy scenes
610,00:22:44.600,1364600,00:22:46.560,1366560,chunk611.wav,28398,right there are plenty of successful
611,00:22:46.320,1366320,00:22:48.720,1368720,chunk612.wav,28485,comedians who have only been on JRE once
612,00:22:48.520,1368520,00:22:50.940,1370940,chunk613.wav,30166,or twice in total or even just never at
613,00:22:51.120,1371120,00:22:52.899,1372899,chunk614.wav,30139,all but Shane actually explained this
614,00:22:53.360,1373360,00:22:54.880,1374880,chunk615.wav,30240,really well and I covered it in a
615,00:22:54.679,1374679,00:22:56.659,1376659,chunk616.wav,30127,previous video titled Cat Williams

617,00:22:58.640,1378640,00:23:01.080,1381080,chunk618.wav,27383,basically outlined how just going on JRE
618,00:23:01.120,1381120,00:23:03.240,1383240,chunk619.wav,30117,once or twice doesn't give you much of a
619,00:23:03.520,1383520,00:23:05.219,1385219,chunk620.wav,27648,bump but when you're appearing on there
620,00:23:05.360,1385360,00:23:07.040,1387040,chunk621.wav,30069,regularly and getting all of that
621,00:23:06.919,1386919,00:23:08.479,1388479,chunk622.wav,29123,exposure especially if it's a good
622,00:23:08.720,1388720,00:23:10.319,1390319,chunk623.wav,28590,appearance and everyone's laughing and
623,00:23:10.039,1390039,00:23:12.099,1392099,chunk624.wav,30259,having a good time that's when you start
624,00:23:11.919,1391919,00:23:14.379,1394379,chunk625.wav,30697,to see the real payoff some of those

626,00:23:16.840,1396840,00:23:19.140,1399140,chunk627.wav,30203,hours so yeah he's definitely part of
627,00:23:19.279,1399279,00:23:21.199,1401199,chunk628.wav,26360,the brogen crew and it seems like Shane
628,00:23:21.440,1401440,00:23:23.660,1403660,chunk629.wav,29381,is trying to stick to doing his regular

630,00:23:25.880,1405880,00:23:27.740,1407740,chunk631.wav,30794,which is funny because they're
631,00:23:27.400,1407400,00:23:29.659,1409659,chunk632.wav,30794,absolutely killing it on YouTube and

634,00:23:35.000,1415000,00:23:36.779,1416779,chunk635.wav,29890,know that's got to be the record for all

639,00:23:45.799,1425799,00:23:47.559,1427559,chunk640.wav,23943,much of a difference there is between
640,00:23:47.360,1427360,00:23:49.920,1429920,chunk641.wav,30370,the production quality of flagrant
641,00:23:49.320,1429320,00:23:51.999,1431999,chunk642.wav,30343,versus MSP Matt and Shane are making
642,00:23:52.480,1432480,00:23:54.759,1434759,chunk643.wav,27842,serious bank and they pretty much get to
643,00:23:54.679,1434679,00:23:56.719,1436719,chunk644.wav,29417,keep all of it to themselves instead of
644,00:23:57.039,1437039,00:23:59.359,1439359,chunk645.wav,31114,having to pay all the those overheads
645,00:23:58.760,1438760,00:24:01.300,1441300,chunk646.wav,30290,and staff and equipment and Studio costs
646,00:24:01.679,1441679,00:24:03.539,1443539,chunk647.wav,28955,that flagrant would have to pay for
647,00:24:03.840,1443840,00:24:05.480,1445480,chunk648.wav,30337,anyway it's just an interesting
648,00:24:05.400,1445400,00:24:07.300,1447300,chunk649.wav,27789,observation Shane seems like he's
